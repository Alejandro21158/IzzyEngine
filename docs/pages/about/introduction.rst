What's Izzy Engine?
-------------------
Izzy Engine is a complete recreation of Friday Night Funkin'.
Think of it as `opsu! <https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu>`_ but for Friday Night Funkin', with great customizability in mind.
But, what does Izzy Engine has that others don't? This next section will exactly tell you that.

Izzy Engine features
--------------------
The first and striking feature of this engine is to be able to make custom content, **without the source code!**
The solid modding system allows it to be more accessible to all kinds of modders.
Since this is a general purpose engine, both beginner and advanced users can put their content with ease.

Here are the lists of features currently implemented:

* Custom weeks and songs
* Character creation system
* Note skins creation system
* Stage scripting
* Song event system
* Backwards compatibility with vanilla charts

Features waiting to be implemented:

* Izzy Engine chart standard
* Script modules (ex: custom dialogue system)
* UI theming and scripting
* Comprehensive debug menu and modding UI
* Modular options menu

\...and many more to be planned!
